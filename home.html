                I am currently studying Bachelor of Science in Information Technology 
                at San Pedro College of Business Administration. This course allows 
                me to develop technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and 
                critical thinking, all of which are essential for a career in the IT industry. 
                Through this program, I aim to combine my passion for technology with 
                my goal of serving my country as a “man in uniform” in the field of IT.

                    Every small discovery makes me more excited to explore and try out new ideas. 
                    I enjoy observing, experimenting, and seeing progress step by step.

                    to make things work is what keeps me motivated every day. 
                    I like turning obstacles into opportunities to grow and improve myself.

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                Hi! I’m Christian Razon, 22 years old and a proud Scorpio. I like to think I’m funny and easy to get along with, 
                but don’t try to test my patience—when I get annoyed, trust me, it’s better to stay out of the way. 
                I enjoy meeting new people, sharing laughs, and making everyday moments a little brighter. 
                I like to stay curious and learn new things, whether it’s about technology, life, or even the small challenges that come my way. 
                Friendly, determined, and always trying to balance work, studies, and fun, I believe that a good sense of humor 
                paired with hard work is the key to staying motivated and making progress in life.
            </p>

        <!-- SKILLS -->
        <div class="about-box">
            <h3>Skills</h3>
            <p>
                I have a solid foundation in basic computer knowledge and typing skills, built from years of using computers and gaming, 
                which also taught me patience and focus. I have basic communication skills, which I strengthened during my one-year experience 
                working in a BPO environment. Beyond tech, I also have basic basketball skills, enjoy casual sports, and can handle simple household chores. 
                I like learning by doing, and I’m always open to picking up new skills that can help me grow personally and professionally.
            </p>

        <!-- EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND -->
        <div class="about-box">
            <h3>Educational Background</h3>
            <p>
                I began my educational journey at Maranatha Christian Academy for elementary, then attended Pacita National High School for my secondary education. 
                After high school, I pursued senior high at Pacita Senior High School. My college journey started at Lyceum of Alabang, 
                where I spent my first year, and I am currently continuing my studies at San Pedro College of Business Administration. 
                Each step of my education has taught me discipline, responsibility, and the importance of balancing academics with personal growth and social interaction.
